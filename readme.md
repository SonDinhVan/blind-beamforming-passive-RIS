## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper **“Near-optimal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Configuration: Blind Beamforming with Sensing.”**  
It provides:
- An implementation of **BORN**, a blind beamforming algorithm that uses only RSS measurements
- Notebooks for analysis and simulation
- Reproducible experiments for figures and tables in the paper
